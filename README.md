We introduce `MuseTalk`, a **real-time high quality** lip-syncing model (30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100). MuseTalk can be applied with input videos, e.g., generated by [MuseV](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV), as a complete virtual human solution.

## ðŸ”¥ Updates
We're excited to unveil MuseTalk 1.5. 
This version **(1)** integrates training with perceptual loss, GAN loss, and sync loss, significantly boosting its overall performance. **(2)** We've implemented a two-stage training strategy and a spatio-temporal data sampling approach to strike a balance between visual quality and lip-sync accuracy. 
Learn more details [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10122).
**The inference codes, training codes and model weights of MuseTalk 1.5 are all available now!** ðŸš€

# Overview
`MuseTalk` is a real-time high quality audio-driven lip-syncing model trained in the latent space of `ft-mse-vae`, which

1. modifies an unseen face according to the input audio, with a size of face region of `256 x 256`.
1. supports audio in various languages, such as Chinese, English, and Japanese.
1. supports real-time inference with 30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100.
1. supports modification of the center point of the face region proposes, which **SIGNIFICANTLY** affects generation results. 
1. checkpoint available trained on the HDTF and private dataset.

## Model
![Model Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f4a214-1bdd-4326-983c-e70b478accba)
MuseTalk was trained in latent spaces, where the images were encoded by a freezed VAE. The audio was encoded by a freezed `whisper-tiny` model. The architecture of the generation network was borrowed from the UNet of the `stable-diffusion-v1-4`, where the audio embeddings were fused to the image embeddings by cross-attention. 

Note that although we use a very similar architecture as Stable Diffusion, MuseTalk is distinct in that it is **NOT** a diffusion model. Instead, MuseTalk operates by inpainting in the latent space with a single step.

## Quickstart

### Inference
We provide inference scripts for both versions of MuseTalk:

#### MuseTalk 1.5 (Recommended)
```bash
# Run MuseTalk 1.5 inference
sh inference.sh v1.5 normal
```

#### MuseTalk 1.0
```bash
# Run MuseTalk 1.0 inference
sh inference.sh v1.0 normal
```

The inference script supports both MuseTalk 1.5 and 1.0 models:
- For MuseTalk 1.5: Use the command above with the V1.5 model path
- For MuseTalk 1.0: Use the same script but point to the V1.0 model path

The configuration file `configs/inference/test.yaml` contains the inference settings, including:
- `video_path`: Path to the input video, image file, or directory of images
- `audio_path`: Path to the input audio file

Note: For optimal results, we recommend using input videos with 25fps, which is the same fps used during model training. If your video has a lower frame rate, you can use frame interpolation or convert it to 25fps using ffmpeg.

#### Real-time Inference
For real-time inference, use the following command:
```bash
# Run real-time inference
sh inference.sh v1.5 realtime  # For MuseTalk 1.5
# or
sh inference.sh v1.0 realtime  # For MuseTalk 1.0
```

The real-time inference configuration is in `configs/inference/realtime.yaml`, which includes:
- `preparation`: Set to `True` for new avatar preparation
- `video_path`: Path to the input video
- `bbox_shift`: Adjustable parameter for mouth region control
- `audio_clips`: List of audio clips for generation

Important notes for real-time inference:
1. Set `preparation` to `True` when processing a new avatar
2. After preparation, the avatar will generate videos using audio clips from `audio_clips`
3. The generation process can achieve 30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100
4. Set `preparation` to `False` for generating more videos with the same avatar

For faster generation without saving images, you can use:
```bash
python -m scripts.realtime_inference --inference_config configs/inference/realtime.yaml --skip_save_images
```

## Training

### Data Preparation
To train MuseTalk, you need to prepare your dataset following these steps:

1. **Place your source videos** 

   For example, if you're using the HDTF dataset, place all your video files in `./dataset/HDTF/source`.

2. **Run the preprocessing script**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.preprocess --config ./configs/training/preprocess.yaml
   ```
   This script will:
   - Extract frames from videos
   - Detect and align faces
   - Generate audio features
   - Create the necessary data structure for training

### Training Process
After data preprocessing, you can start the training process:

1. **First Stage**
   ```bash
   sh train.sh stage1
   ```

2. **Second Stage**
   ```bash
   sh train.sh stage2
   ```

### Configuration Adjustment
Before starting the training, you should adjust the configuration files according to your hardware and requirements:

1. **GPU Configuration** (`configs/training/gpu.yaml`):
   - `gpu_ids`: Specify the GPU IDs you want to use (e.g., "0,1,2,3")
   - `num_processes`: Set this to match the number of GPUs you're using

2. **Stage 1 Configuration** (`configs/training/stage1.yaml`):
   - `data.train_bs`: Adjust batch size based on your GPU memory (default: 32)
   - `data.n_sample_frames`: Number of sampled frames per video (default: 1)

3. **Stage 2 Configuration** (`configs/training/stage2.yaml`):
   - `random_init_unet`: Must be set to `False` to use the model from stage 1
   - `data.train_bs`: Smaller batch size due to high GPU memory cost (default: 2)
   - `data.n_sample_frames`: Higher value for temporal consistency (default: 16)
   - `solver.gradient_accumulation_steps`: Increase to simulate larger batch sizes (default: 8)
  

### GPU Memory Requirements
Based on our testing on a machine with 8 NVIDIA H20 GPUs:

#### Stage 1 Memory Usage
| Batch Size | Gradient Accumulation | Memory per GPU | Recommendation |
|:----------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 8          | 1                      | ~32GB          |                |
| 16         | 1                      | ~45GB          |                |
| 32         | 1                      | ~74GB          | âœ“              |

#### Stage 2 Memory Usage
| Batch Size | Gradient Accumulation | Memory per GPU | Recommendation |
|:----------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 1          | 8                      | ~54GB          |                |
| 2          | 2                      | ~80GB          |                |
| 2          | 8                      | ~85GB          | âœ“              |

#### Use of bbox_shift to have adjustable results(For 1.0)
:mag_right: We have found that upper-bound of the mask has an important impact on mouth openness. Thus, to control the mask region, we suggest using the `bbox_shift` parameter. Positive values (moving towards the lower half) increase mouth openness, while negative values (moving towards the upper half) decrease mouth openness.

You can start by running with the default configuration to obtain the adjustable value range, and then re-run the script within this range. 

For example, in the case of `Xinying Sun`, after running the default configuration, it shows that the adjustable value rage is [-9, 9]. Then, to decrease the mouth openness, we set the value to be `-7`. 
```
python -m scripts.inference --inference_config configs/inference/test.yaml --bbox_shift -7 
```
:pushpin: More technical details can be found in [bbox_shift](assets/BBOX_SHIFT.md).


#### Combining MuseV and MuseTalk

As a complete solution to virtual human generation, you are suggested to first apply [MuseV](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV) to generate a video (text-to-video, image-to-video or pose-to-video) by referring [this](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV?tab=readme-ov-file#text2video). Frame interpolation is suggested to increase frame rate. Then, you can use `MuseTalk` to generate a lip-sync video by referring [this](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk?tab=readme-ov-file#inference).

Thanks for open-sourcing!

# Limitations
- Resolution: Though MuseTalk uses a face region size of 256 x 256, which make it better than other open-source methods, it has not yet reached the theoretical resolution bound. We will continue to deal with this problem.  
If you need higher resolution, you could apply super resolution models such as [GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN) in combination with MuseTalk.

- Identity preservation: Some details of the original face are not well preserved, such as mustache, lip shape and color.

- Jitter: There exists some jitter as the current pipeline adopts single-frame generation.
