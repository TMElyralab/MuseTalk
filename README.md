**[github](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk)**    **[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/TMElyralab/MuseTalk)**    **[space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TMElyralab/MuseTalk)**    **[Technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10122)**

We introduce `MuseTalk`, a **real-time high quality** lip-syncing model (30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100). MuseTalk can be applied with input videos, e.g., generated by [MuseV](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV), as a complete virtual human solution.

## 🔥 Updates
We're excited to unveil MuseTalk 1.5. 
This version **(1)** integrates training with perceptual loss, GAN loss, and sync loss, significantly boosting its overall performance. **(2)** We've implemented a two-stage training strategy and a spatio-temporal data sampling approach to strike a balance between visual quality and lip-sync accuracy. 
Learn more details [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10122).
**The inference codes, training codes and model weights of MuseTalk 1.5 are all available now!** 🚀

# Overview
`MuseTalk` is a real-time high quality audio-driven lip-syncing model trained in the latent space of `ft-mse-vae`, which

1. modifies an unseen face according to the input audio, with a size of face region of `256 x 256`.
1. supports audio in various languages, such as Chinese, English, and Japanese.
1. supports real-time inference with 30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100.

## Model
![Model Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f4a214-1bdd-4326-983c-e70b478accba)
MuseTalk was trained in latent spaces, where the images were encoded by a freezed VAE. The audio was encoded by a freezed `whisper-tiny` model. The architecture of the generation network was borrowed from the UNet of the `stable-diffusion-v1-4`, where the audio embeddings were fused to the image embeddings by cross-attention. 

Note that although we use a very similar architecture as Stable Diffusion, MuseTalk is distinct in that it is **NOT** a diffusion model. Instead, MuseTalk operates by inpainting in the latent space with a single step.

```
## Quickstart

### Inference
We provide inference scripts for both versions of MuseTalk:

#### Prerequisites
Before running inference, please ensure ffmpeg is installed and accessible:
```bash
# Check ffmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version
```
If ffmpeg is not found, please install it first:
- Windows: Download from [ffmpeg-static](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) and add to PATH
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

#### Normal Inference
##### Linux Environment
```bash
# MuseTalk 1.5 (Recommended)
sh inference.sh v1.5 normal

# MuseTalk 1.0
sh inference.sh v1.0 normal
```

##### Windows Environment

Please ensure that you set the `ffmpeg_path` to match the actual location of your FFmpeg installation.

```bash
# MuseTalk 1.5 (Recommended)
python -m scripts.inference --inference_config configs\inference\test.yaml --result_dir results\test --unet_model_path models\musetalkV15\unet.pth --unet_config models\musetalkV15\musetalk.json --version v15 --ffmpeg_path ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin

# For MuseTalk 1.0, change:
# - models\musetalkV15 -> models\musetalk
# - unet.pth -> pytorch_model.bin
# - --version v15 -> --version v1
```

#### Real-time Inference
##### Linux Environment
```bash
# MuseTalk 1.5 (Recommended)
sh inference.sh v1.5 realtime

# MuseTalk 1.0
sh inference.sh v1.0 realtime
```

##### Windows Environment
```bash
# MuseTalk 1.5 (Recommended)
python -m scripts.realtime_inference --inference_config configs\inference\realtime.yaml --result_dir results\realtime --unet_model_path models\musetalkV15\unet.pth --unet_config models\musetalkV15\musetalk.json --version v15 --fps 25 --ffmpeg_path ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin

# For MuseTalk 1.0, change:
# - models\musetalkV15 -> models\musetalk
# - unet.pth -> pytorch_model.bin
# - --version v15 -> --version v1
```

The configuration file `configs/inference/test.yaml` contains the inference settings, including:
- `video_path`: Path to the input video, image file, or directory of images
- `audio_path`: Path to the input audio file

Note: For optimal results, we recommend using input videos with 25fps, which is the same fps used during model training. If your video has a lower frame rate, you can use frame interpolation or convert it to 25fps using ffmpeg.

Important notes for real-time inference:
1. Set `preparation` to `True` when processing a new avatar
2. After preparation, the avatar will generate videos using audio clips from `audio_clips`
3. The generation process can achieve 30fps+ on an NVIDIA Tesla V100
4. Set `preparation` to `False` for generating more videos with the same avatar

For faster generation without saving images, you can use:
```bash
python -m scripts.realtime_inference --inference_config configs/inference/realtime.yaml --skip_save_images
```

## Gradio Demo
We provide an intuitive web interface through Gradio for users to easily adjust input parameters. To optimize inference time, users can generate only the **first frame** to fine-tune the best lip-sync parameters, which helps reduce facial artifacts in the final output.
![para](assets/figs/gradio_2.png)
For minimum hardware requirements, we tested the system on a Windows environment using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU with 4GB VRAM. In fp16 mode, generating an 8-second video takes approximately 5 minutes. ![speed](assets/figs/gradio.png)

Both Linux and Windows users can launch the demo using the following command. Please ensure that the `ffmpeg_path` parameter matches your actual FFmpeg installation path:

```bash
# You can remove --use_float16 for better quality, but it will increase VRAM usage and inference time
python app.py --use_float16 --ffmpeg_path ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin
```

## Training

### Data Preparation
To train MuseTalk, you need to prepare your dataset following these steps:

1. **Place your source videos** 

   For example, if you're using the HDTF dataset, place all your video files in `./dataset/HDTF/source`.

2. **Run the preprocessing script**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.preprocess --config ./configs/training/preprocess.yaml
   ```
   This script will:
   - Extract frames from videos
   - Detect and align faces
   - Generate audio features
   - Create the necessary data structure for training

### Training Process
After data preprocessing, you can start the training process:

1. **First Stage**
   ```bash
   sh train.sh stage1
   ```

2. **Second Stage**
   ```bash
   sh train.sh stage2
   ```

### Configuration Adjustment
Before starting the training, you should adjust the configuration files according to your hardware and requirements:

1. **GPU Configuration** (`configs/training/gpu.yaml`):
   - `gpu_ids`: Specify the GPU IDs you want to use (e.g., "0,1,2,3")
   - `num_processes`: Set this to match the number of GPUs you're using

2. **Stage 1 Configuration** (`configs/training/stage1.yaml`):
   - `data.train_bs`: Adjust batch size based on your GPU memory (default: 32)
   - `data.n_sample_frames`: Number of sampled frames per video (default: 1)

3. **Stage 2 Configuration** (`configs/training/stage2.yaml`):
   - `random_init_unet`: Must be set to `False` to use the model from stage 1
   - `data.train_bs`: Smaller batch size due to high GPU memory cost (default: 2)
   - `data.n_sample_frames`: Higher value for temporal consistency (default: 16)
   - `solver.gradient_accumulation_steps`: Increase to simulate larger batch sizes (default: 8)
  

### GPU Memory Requirements
Based on our testing on a machine with 8 NVIDIA H20 GPUs:

#### Stage 1 Memory Usage
| Batch Size | Gradient Accumulation | Memory per GPU | Recommendation |
|:----------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 8          | 1                      | ~32GB          |                |
| 16         | 1                      | ~45GB          |                |
| 32         | 1                      | ~74GB          | ✓              |

#### Stage 2 Memory Usage
| Batch Size | Gradient Accumulation | Memory per GPU | Recommendation |
|:----------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 1          | 8                      | ~54GB          |                |
| 2          | 2                      | ~80GB          |                |
| 2          | 8                      | ~85GB          | ✓              |

#### Use of bbox_shift to have adjustable results(For 1.0)
:mag_right: We have found that upper-bound of the mask has an important impact on mouth openness. Thus, to control the mask region, we suggest using the `bbox_shift` parameter. Positive values (moving towards the lower half) increase mouth openness, while negative values (moving towards the upper half) decrease mouth openness.

You can start by running with the default configuration to obtain the adjustable value range, and then re-run the script within this range. 

For example, in the case of `Xinying Sun`, after running the default configuration, it shows that the adjustable value rage is [-9, 9]. Then, to decrease the mouth openness, we set the value to be `-7`. 
```
python -m scripts.inference --inference_config configs/inference/test.yaml --bbox_shift -7 
```
:pushpin: More technical details can be found in [bbox_shift](assets/BBOX_SHIFT.md).


#### Combining MuseV and MuseTalk

As a complete solution to virtual human generation, you are suggested to first apply [MuseV](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV) to generate a video (text-to-video, image-to-video or pose-to-video) by referring [this](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV?tab=readme-ov-file#text2video). Frame interpolation is suggested to increase frame rate. Then, you can use `MuseTalk` to generate a lip-sync video by referring [this](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk?tab=readme-ov-file#inference).

Thanks for open-sourcing!

# Limitations
- Resolution: Though MuseTalk uses a face region size of 256 x 256, which make it better than other open-source methods, it has not yet reached the theoretical resolution bound. We will continue to deal with this problem.  
If you need higher resolution, you could apply super resolution models such as [GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN) in combination with MuseTalk.
